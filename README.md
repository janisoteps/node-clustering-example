# Node + ExpressJs clustering example

It allows your app to spawn multiple worker processes to handle requests. Imagine a team of workers sharing the load instead of one overwhelmed employee. That’s clustering doing its thing, making your app faster and more responsive.

## Improvements:
* Increased performance: Say goodbye to bottlenecks and hello to parallel processing.
* Scale like a boss: More requests? No problem. Clustering scales your app gracefully.
* Keeps the lights on: If a worker trips, another steps in. Your app stays up without breaking a sweat.
Let’s see it in action!
